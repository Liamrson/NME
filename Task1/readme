>>> Server is performing SSL offloading to reduce load on Applications server.

Metrics to monitor, how to monitor and challenges involved.
===========================================================

Metrics
=======

- CPU load ('mpstat' or 'top' command in Linux or 'cat /proc/loadavg')
---- Shows CPU load at given time.
- Disk Input/output & usage ('iostat' for I/O  // 'df' for disk usage)
---- How much disk space has been used and what the current read/write usage is.
- Open TCP connections ('netstat' and/or 'ss')
---- Total number of active TCP connections that are established.
- Memory free ('cat /proc/meminfo')
---- The amount of RAM being used
- bytes sent and received ('ifconfig')
---- Total amount of sent/received data on interface(s)

- SSL Cert expiry check to make sure Certificate is valid.
---- Can use existing community made template on Zabbix: https://share.zabbix.com/cat-app/web-servers/ssl-certificates-check

Method A
========
Create a Python script that monitors /proc/ readouts or executes a linux command and extracts useable data. Can be periodically run by use of Cron job.

Method B
========
Scripts/plugins can be created and used in monitoring tools like Zabbix, Nagios.
Example of some metrics listed above can be found here: https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/4.0/manual/config/items/itemtypes/zabbix_agent


Challenges
==========
- Monitoring itself takes system resources, so planning what to monitor and how frequently to avoid unnecessary load on server.
- Setting or coding proper limits to reduce false positives.
- Writing effective code to monitor those metrics and/or setting up monitoring server.
